# Design Condisderations for the Median Forest Program

This software is intended to perform several functions:

It is capable of performing imputation on missing data in order to calculate appropriate values for such. 

It is capable of performing multivariate regression on samples based on limited feature inputs.

It is capable of reporting back on feature relationships and interactions in the regression. 

The underlying function of the software is based on an implementation of decision tree based regression, both gradient boosted and plain random forest.

The random forest implementation is able to ignore dropped values during regression, and performs splits of data by minimizing Median Absolute Deviation from the Median (hereafter MAD) L1, L2, or .5L, the fractional L norm. 

Gradient boosting can be performed by summing error matrices or by over-representing error-prone features and samples. 

To aid interpretation, the program provides certain summary outputs that allow you to determine if appropriate norming, boosting, and ensemble integration was performed. 

The purpose of this program is interpretation of single-cell RNA Seq data, but it is appropriate for interpretation of other high-dimensional data. 

The general structure of the program is as follows:

The outer-most class is the Random Forest



# Random Forests:

A Random Forest contains

   * The matrix to be analyzed
   * Prototype Tree
   * Predictive Decision Trees
   * Decision Tree Thread Pool

Important methods

   * Method that initializes a forest and generates a prototype Tree and a Tree Thread Pool
   * Method that requests several Predictive Trees from a Tree Thread Pool
   * Method that generates predicted values for a matrix of samples

Random Forests are the outermost structure used for Random Forest-based regression.

 Random Forests are initialized with knowledge of the dimensions of the trees that they will contain and the data to be analyzed. Upon initialization a random forest will first generate a prototype Tree. 
 
 The prototype Tree contains all dimensions and all samples of data to be analyzed, and will serve as a template from which to generate other Trees. However the prototype tree has no splits, and has not had grow_branches() called on it. A prototype tree also owns a Feature Thread Pool, but said pool has only one thread. 
 
 The Random Forest will then initialize a Tree Thread Pool, and then request that Predictive Trees be generated from it. After Predictive Trees are generated, the Random Forest can store them and/or can use them to make predictions about a given sample based on data available about it.

# Tree Thread Pool:

 A Tree Thread Pool contains:
     * Worker Threads
     * Reciever Channel for jobs
     
Important methods:
     * Initialization method
     * Termination method


 A Tree Thread Pool is able to generate Predictive Trees on request. When a Tree Thread Pool is generated, it must be passed a prototype Tree. The Tree Thread Pool then generates several worker threads that contain clones of the prototype Tree, and which are able to generate predictive trees. The initializer for the Tree Thread Pool returns a mpsc Sender channel which is able to receive requests for Predictive Trees. The sender channel must receive a usize representing a unique ID for the tree to be generated and another sender channel that allows the thread pool to send back the generated tree. 

 Each worker thread is on a loop attempting to receive jobs from a Mutex that is shared among all worker threads. Each worker attempts to acquire a lock and then blocks the channel contained in the Mutex with a recv() call. Once a message containing a usize ID is received, the worker thread checks the ID. If ID is 0, the loop is broken and the thread terminates. If ID is not 0, a new Tree is derived from the prototype Tree with dimensions that are given by the Tree Thread Pool. Feature and Sample subsampling is random. 

 Usage note: Please note that the splitting algorithm used by Median Forests is deterministic so if subsampling settings are such that all samples and all features are subsampled, all trees generated by a Random Forest will be exactly identical. This generally leads to poor quality predictions. 

# Trees:

 Trees contain:
     * Root Node
     * Feature Thread Pool Sender Channel
     * Drop Mode

Important methods:
     * Derive (various versions)
     * grow_branches()


 Each tree contains a subsampling of both rows and columns of the original matrix. The subsampled rows and columns are contained in a root node, which is the only node the tree has direct access to. A tree knows how to grow branches, ie it can send a request to the root node to perform the best possible split on itself, then the best possible split on the two resulting child nodes, and so on until reaching the per-leaf sample limit. 


# Feature Thread Pool:

 Feature Thread Pool contains:
     * Worker Threads
     * Reciever Channel for jobs

Important methods:
     * A wrapper method to compute a set of medians and MADs for each job passed to the pool. Core method logic is in Rank Vector

 Feature Thread Pools are containers of Worker threads. Each pool contains a multiple in, single out channel locked with a Mutex. Each Worker contained in the pool continuously requests jobs from the channel. If the Mutex is unlocked and has a job, a Worker thread receives it.

     Jobs:
         Jobs in the pool channel consist of a channel to pass back the solution to the underlying problem and a freshly spawned Rank Vector (see below). The job consists of calling a method on the RV that consumes it and produces the medians and Median Absolute Deviations (MAD) from the Median of the vector if a set of samples is removed from it in a given order. This allows us to determine what the Median Absolute Deviation from the Median would be given the split of that feature by some draw order. The draw orders given to each job are usually denoting that the underlying matrix was sorted by another feature.

 Worker threads are simple anonymous threads kept in a vector in the pool, requesting jobs on loop from the channel.
