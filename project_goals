Ultimate Project Goals:

  -Find Gene Regulatory Relationships

    - Gene X regulates gene Y
  
Goals of This Repository:

  - Impute "expected" gene values

  - Deduce gene interactions (Eg regression, secondary)
  
  - Given imputed values, find interactions "below the surface"
  
Secret Supra-Ultimate Project Goals:

  - Understand differences in gene regulation in aged vs young cells
